/**
 * NexthopCache: Thread-safe cache of nexthop reachability and IGP cost.
 *
 * Two independent sources feed this cache:
 *
 *   1. FsdbFibWatcher — subscribes to FSDB FIB host routes for statically
 *      configured BGP peers (multi-hop or directly connected). Updates carry
 *      isConnected=nullopt because FIB entries do not imply L2 adjacency.
 *
 *   2. FsdbNeighborWatcher — watches ARP/NDP resolution on local interfaces.
 *      Updates carry isConnected=true, marking the nexthop as directly
 *      connected. This is the sole authority for directly connected nexthops.
 *
 * Source-priority rule (enforced in addOrUpdateNextHopStatus):
 *   Once a nexthop is marked isConnected=true (by NeighborWatcher), only
 *   another isConnected=true update can modify it. Non-connected sources
 *   (FsdbFibWatcher with isConnected=nullopt) are silently skipped. This
 *   prevents stale FIB data from overriding authoritative ARP/NDP-based
 *   connectivity and IGP cost for directly connected nexthops.
 *
 * Dynamic peers:
 *   Dynamic peers (configured with CIDR peer_addr) are always directly
 *   connected — ARP/NDP must resolve before a TCP/BGP session can form.
 *   NeighborWatcher reports them with isConnected=true before any routes
 *   arrive. They are NOT subscribed in FsdbFibWatcher (which only tracks
 *   static peers with exact IP peer_addr), so there is no conflict.
