/**
 * Global table of local interface prefixes across ALL tracked interfaces, used
 * to classify whether a nexthop is directly connected. Backed by a single radix
 * tree keyed on the prefix (network/masklen), so classification is one
 * O(address-bits) longest-prefix (best) match instead of a scan over per-
 * interface tables. The tree splits v4/v6 internally, so families never mix.
 *
 * Each prefix node's value maps every contributing interface host address to
 * its interface index (e.g. a primary 10.0.0.1 and a secondary 10.0.0.2 both
 * configured on 10.0.0.0/16 of the same interface). Keeping the map of
 * contributors (not a bare refcount) makes duplicate address events idempotent
 * and keeps a prefix directly connected as long as at least one address still
 * contributes it, so removing one of several addresses in a subnet does not
 * declassify peers still reachable via another. The stored ifindex lets the
 * interface-state path resolve a covered nexthop's reachability from the
 * covering interface's link state via coveringIfIndex().
 *
 * On a routed backbone a subnet lives on exactly one L3 interface, so a covered
 * nexthop resolves to a single interface index.
 *
 * Only populated when bgp_resolve_nexthops_from_interface_state is on.
