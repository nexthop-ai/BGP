/*
 * E2E tests for AdjRibOut delay functionality.
 *
 * These tests verify out-delay timer behavior and staggered route
 * advertisement through the complete BGP pipeline.
 *
 * Key behaviors tested:
 * 1. Routes appear in egress queue after out-delay expires
 * 2. Update coalescing during delay period (implicit withdrawal)
 * 3. Explicit withdrawals bypass out-delay (sent immediately)
 * 4. Initial dump bypasses out-delay
 * 5. Route flap handling with out-delay
 *
 * Mocked: FIB (TestFib), SessionManager (MockSessionManager)
 * Real: RIB, PeerManager, AdjRib
