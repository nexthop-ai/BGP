/*
 * E2E test: a community-gated egress SetNexthop policy combined with egress
 * queue backpressure.
 *
 * The egress policy EGRESS_POLICY_WITH_SET_NEXTHOP has two terms:
 *   term1: if the route carries kSetNexthopCommunity -> SetNexthop(10.0.0.1)
 *          and clear the community list, then accept.
 *   term2: catch-all -> clear the community list, then accept.
 *
 * Scenario: the receiving peer's egress queue is padded so it is blocked
 * (highWm=1) BEFORE any route is advertised. A prefix is then announced twice
 * in succession while the queue stays blocked, so both updates collapse in the
 * AdjRib packing list and only the final state is ever advertised:
 *   announce #1: 5.0.0.0/8, nexthop 10.0.0.1, no community.
 *   announce #2: 5.0.0.0/8, with kSetNexthopCommunity attached (the flap).
 *
 * The receiving peer is eBGP, so nexthop-self would normally rewrite the
 * nexthop to the local peering address. term1's SetNexthop overrides
 * nexthop-self, so the single collapsed advertisement is expected to be
 * 5.0.0.0/8 with nexthop 10.0.0.1 and no communities.
 *
 * Mocked: FIB (TestFib), SessionManager (MockSessionManager)
 * Real: RIB, PeerManager, AdjRib, PolicyManager
