/**
 * Bounded hysteresis queue with locks, inspired from
 * centralium::coro::MPMCQueue.
 *
 * Queue maintains internal state bool blocked_.
 *  - If queue was not blocked and its size exceeds hiWm, then the
 *    queue state is set to blocked.
 *  - If queue was blocked and its size decreases below loWm, then the
 *    queue state is set to unblocked.
 *
 * This state is exposed through the public isBlocked method.
 *
 * For an SPSC scenario, this means once the producer pushes #highWm number
 * of objects to the queue, the consumer must consume enough objects
 * until queue size is below #lowWm before the queue becomes 'unblocked'.
 *
 * If the queue size is at capacity, the push call can fail. Producer
 * would need to check if the queue is blocked (or full) before pushing.
 *
 * Producers that choose to wait for the queue to be unblocked
 * can explicitly wait on a semaphore that will signal once the queue becomes
 * unblocked. Producers should ALWAYS CHECK isBlocked() first before waiting.

   * If the semaphore has no tokens available, then the producer is made to
   * wait for both of the following conditions to become true:
   *   1. the writeSem_ is given a token from the popNoLock() API
   *      when queue size decreases below lowWm_,
   *   2. the queue state is NOT blocked.
   *
   * Notes:
   * We should ALWAYS check isBlocked() first before calling. Otherwise
   * this can result in a deadlock, because the producer will be waiting for
   * a queue to unblock when it is already unblocked. In a single producer case,
   * this means the producer will be stuck waiting forever because it does not
   * know it can push to the queue, and can never put the queue into a blocked
   * state again.
   *
   * We should additionally check isBlocked() when the writeSem_ returns
   * a token. The writeSem_ will signal regardless of if the producer was
   * waiting on it. Let's say producer P is putting items into Q.
   *
   *  1. P pushes items to the high watermark.
   *  2. Q becomes blocked but P doesn't wait.
   *  3. Consumer C pops enough items to unblock the Q, and sends a signal
   *     which is stored in the semaphore.
   *  4. P comes back to push more items. Q becomes blocked. P tries to wait;
   *     it sees the previous signal from C at the first block <-> unblock, and
   *     would resume pushing even though Q is blocked.
   * P should not be allowed to push because Q is blocked, so it needs
   * to wait for the next unblock signal.
   *
   * Thread Safety:
   * - closed_ is std::atomic<bool> (sequentially consistent)
   * - We check closed_ BEFORE and AFTER the semaphore wait
   * - The semaphore is counting, so signal() never "loses" a token
   * - If close() happens before we enter co_wait(), the token is waiting
   * - If close() happens during co_wait(), we wake up and see closed_=true
